# Snoopy Client

## Installation & Setup
Run `npm install` to install all necessary packages. Then run `npm build` to build the JS files. Now
you should be able to open `./public/index.html` in your browser. Alternatively, you can run `npm
watch` to automatically re-build when you modify any of the project Typescript files. 

Run tests with the command `npm test`.
