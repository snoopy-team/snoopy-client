# Snoopy Game / 2D Game Engine
## The Story
I was working with 2 friends on a final project for my Artificial Intelligence class - our idea was to build an AI powered Snoopy game (from Charlie Brown). I took the responsibility to make the game's front-end but hadn't used any game engines, so I set out to do everything from scratch. What resulted after 2 weeks was a basic 2D game engine. See the clips below!

## Quick Clips
### Simulation of 2D bodies (Snoopy!)

### Cut between virtual cameras (each can have a different zoom and centering)

### Debug camera gives you the ability to zoom and pan

### Shake Effect - cameras can have time-based effects (like a basic version of shaders)

### Switch between each camera by pressing 'c'

## Installation & Setup
Run `npm install` to install all necessary packages. Then run `npm build` to build the JS files. Now
you should be able to open `./public/index.html` in your browser. Alternatively, you can run `npm
watch` to automatically re-build when you modify any of the project Typescript files. 

Run tests with the command `npm test`.
